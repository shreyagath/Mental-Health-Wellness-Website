                <h1>Acrylic Painting</h1>
                <p>
                    Acrylic painting is an art style that is created using synthetic acrylic resins. 
                    Acrylics dry rapidly and give the visual impression of both watercolour and oil paintings. 
                    Acrylic paintings became popular in the 20th century when artists were concerned about the 
                    health risk posed by handling oil paints and its fumes.
