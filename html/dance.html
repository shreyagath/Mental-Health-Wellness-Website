                <h1>Bharatnatyam</h1>
                <p>Bharatanatyam, is the oldest Indian classical dance form originated in the Tanjore district of tamil
                    Nadu
                    and regarded as the mother of many other classical dance forms of India. “It gives a wonderful
                    cardio workout,
                    improves blood circulation,tones muscles and is good for bone density as it is a contact exercise,”
                    says danseuse Alarmel Valli.

                <p>Native to North India, Kathak (pronounced “Kah-tahk”) is one of six Indian classical dance forms.
                    Kathak originated within Hindu temples as a storytelling device for portraying the epic tales from
                    Hindu scriptures,
                    Mahabharata and Ramayana.
                    Poetry was combined with rhythmic movement to aid in the worshipful storytelling.

                <h1>Jazz</h1>
                <p>Jazz dance paralleled the birth and spread of jazz itself from roots in Black American society and
                    was popularized in
                    ballrooms by the big bands of the swing era (1930s and ’40s).
                    It radically altered the style of American and European stage and social dance in the 20th century.
                    Jazz dance developed from both 19th- and 20th-century stage dance and traditional
                    Black social dances and their white ballroom offshoots.

                <h1>Ballet</h1>
                <p>Ballet (French: [balɛ]) is a type of performance dance that originated during the Italian Renaissance
                    in the fifteenth century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia.
                    Ballet requires discipline not found in many other forms of dance. It enjoys a history not found in
                    many more modern genres of movement. Ballet encompasses the “dancer dream”,
                    and continues to resonate in the hearts and minds of little children like no other style of dance.
